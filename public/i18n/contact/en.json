We share a lot of great memories with them and are more than happy to be calling them our best people.\n\n Soon enough Priska and Christian realized that the job of being the best people is not one which can be easily carried out by only two persons. However, clever as they are, they came up with and an adequate and timely solution in the form of little Ms. Sgier.", 
    "bridesmaids": "We present Mahra’s lovely bridesmaids: Vanessa and Julia! \n Mahra was lucky to meet these two amazing fellow engineers while working for UBS Card Center. \n The reason they became friends? Not the fact they had to fix the IT systems on multiple occasions together, no… The fact that all of them had the same Garmin watch. \n Not only did these to ladies support the bride during the planning, they will also happily help you out on our wedding day.",

Our best man and the maid of honor however will be happy to help you out even then."
