    "ourStoryText": "After more than a decade, we want to make it official!\n\n The two of us first met in high school and instantly fell madly in love (well, maybe not instantly... as they say it's a marathon, not a sprint) with each other.\n\n Soon, Mahra had to learn that ‚Äútaarof‚Äù was an extremely strange concept to Valentin, and if she wanted to actually get some food or drinks at her boyfriend's house she had to abandon it completely.\n Valentin on the other hand realized that food was not an option but an obligation at a Persian household, no matter how ‚Äúfull‚Äù a person is. \n\n Fast forward a few years and we still managed not to get sick of one another, but rather realized that a temperamental Persian and a level-headed Swiss do make a great pair. Valentin focused on his engineering studies at the ETH and Mahra had her head in the clouds by watching galaxies in outer space.\n Little did we know that a few years later she is the one with an engineering job title and he is building satellites to be sent into outer space. \n\n Now, finally settled in our apartment, jobs, and having gotten used to our two fluffy roommates, Valentin popped the question on November 17, 2021. Nearly 1.5 years later, we are looking forward to inviting you to our special day and to be celebrating the past 13 years of our relationship with you, and toast to the many more that are to come ü§ç",
