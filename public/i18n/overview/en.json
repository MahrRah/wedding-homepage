And if she wanted to actually get some food or drinks at her boyfriends house she had to abandon it completely. \n\n Valentin on the other hand realized that food was not an option at a Persian household, no matter how “full” a person is. \n\n Fast forward a few years Valentin focused on his engineering studies  at the ETH and Mahra had her head in the cloud by watching galaxies in outer space.\n\n Eventhouth of the hectic studies and adjusting to the new apartments, with our two fluffy roommates, we were going strong.\n\n Little did we know that a few years later, she is the one with an engineering job title and he is building satellites to be sent into outer space.
